SchoolMate is a mobile application made for iOS devices. To login into the app, users must first fill out their information on the "Register" page or authenticate using Google. Once in the app, users can view the home page, profile page, attendance page, fundraisers page, calendar page, and job listings page. On the home page, you can view other students' posts to like and see what is happening at school. On the profile page, you can view all your posts, delete those posts, log out of your account, or delete your account. On the attendance page, you can submit your daily attendance for that day. The fundraiser's page consists of different types of fundraisers going around at that given time. The calendar page is made to show a calendar with all the upcoming events integrated into it to enhance the userâ€™s experience. The jobs listing page was created to help high school students find different jobs nearby that were currently hiring. This page will show each position available and if clicked, will show a description of that job and the pay of the job. To further enhance our app, we have also added a "store" where users can purchase clothes from their schools. We also have a section on our app titled "More" which consists of Settings and Report Bugs. On the Settings page, you can enter your personal information, switch dark mode on or off, change your password, subscribe to updates, and view the following documents: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and About Us. On the "About Us" page in Settings, there is an email and a phone number included to directly communicate with us about any questions or concerns. SchoolMate is currently error-free, however, a bug-reporting system is implemented if the user later discovers an issue.
