SchoolMate is a mobile application made for iOS devices. To login into the app, users must first fil out information on the "Register" page or authenticate using Google. Once in the app, users can view current posts by other students, profile post's, attendance page, fundraisers, calendar, and job listings. To furthur enhance our app, we have also added a "store" where users can purchase clothes from their schools. We also have in the calendar or on the event pages. From bath locations there are also options to sign up for upcoming events and meetings. On the "About FBLA" page there are links to state and national websites as well as a O and A section. To connect with their chapter, users have access to links to social media, as well as a place to email their director directly from the application. Lists of members in the users chapter, as well as local, state, and national officer teams are also provided if the user wishes to contact them instead Officers and directors may interact with the application by logging on to the website, fblamanager.me, where they can create and post new events and messages, as well as track users and meeting attendance. SchoolMate is currently error free, however a bug reporting system is implemented if the user later discovers an issue.
